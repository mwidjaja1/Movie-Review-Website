Movie-Review-Website
====================

2014 | wImagineering University

This script creates a website to display movie trailers.

1. Each movie is built from a class called 'Movie' as defined in media.py.
2. Each movie is then given its own object from said class, as defined in entertainmentCenter.py.
3. This data is then transferred to fresh_tomatoes.html & fresh_tomatoes.py (which were both provided as part of the class) and this uses the objects from entertainmentCenter.py and makes a website out of it.
